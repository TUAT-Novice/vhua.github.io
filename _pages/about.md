Welcome to my personal homepage!!! My name is LI Binghua, a doctoral student from China. I received my master's degree from [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/) in China, under the supervision of Prof. [DUAN Feng](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38295033800?history=no&highlight=true&returnType=SEARCH&sortType=newest&pageNumber=1&searchWithin=%22Author%20Ids%22:38295033800&returnFacets=ALL).
As a research intern, I have spent half a year at [RIKEN AIP](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/) during my master's studies, researching on tensor decomposition in Tensor Learning Team led by Prof. [ZHAO Qibin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=cSQGe3YAAAAJ).
Currently, I'm a doctoral students from [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.tuat.ac.jp/) of [Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology](https://www.tuat.ac.jp/), supervised by Prof. [TANAKA Toshihisa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=pBXvYnwAAAAJ).

My research interests and achievements over the past few years encompass tensor decomposition, medical imaging analysis, model interpretability and large-scale model. You can also find my [CV](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf) in this page for more details.
